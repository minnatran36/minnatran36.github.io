      <h1>Minna</h1>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I believe that behind every algorithm and every breakthrough lies a deeper question: What kind of world are we building—and for whom?</p>
      <p>I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a focus on Natural Language Processing—a field that captivates me because it lives at the intersection of machine logic and human meaning. My background spans computer science, economics, and finance. I began in economics and behavioral science, drawn to the question of how people make decisions and shape systems—but I soon realized that theory alone wasn’t enough. We need tools to anchor these ideas, to test and build. That’s what led me to computer science.</p>
      <p>You could say I’ve come full circle: starting with the study of human behavior, extending into the technical machinery of computation, and now returning—through NLP—to a more integrated understanding of both. To me, these disciplines aren’t separate. They form a single, connected lens for understanding how we communicate, decide, and design the systems we live in.</p>
      <p>As a young mother raising a son in a rapidly changing world, I see firsthand how the technologies we create today will shape the world he inherits. This work feels both personal and urgent. I want to help build a future that is not just technologically advanced, but also sustainable, humane, and worthy of the next generation—children like my own.</p>
      <p>Einstein once said, "Concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors." That belief guides everything I do. I want to contribute to technologies that are not just intelligent, but ethical—tools that expand access to knowledge, make decisions more transparent, and strengthen our communities. My conviction is simple: technology should extend our humanity. One cannot thrive without the other.</p>
      <p>Stay in touch — I'll reach out when I have something meaningful to share.</p>
