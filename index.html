      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I didn’t come to Computer Science through machines. I came through people—through trying to understand how we think, how we make meaning, how we try to connect.</p>
      <p>I started in economics and behavioral science, drawn to the patterns behind human behavior. But theory only takes you so far. At some point, I wanted tools—something I could build with, test ideas through, and learn from in the real world.</p>
      <p>That search led me to Computer Science, and eventually to Natural Language Processing. It felt like the right intersection: structure and ambiguity, systems and language. A space where you can model behavior—but also listen to it.</p>
      <p>I’m also a parent, which sharpens the stakes. I think often about the world my son will inherit—not just the tools we pass down, but the assumptions built into them. I want to be part of shaping systems that remain aware of the people inside them. That leave space for complexity. That don’t mistake efficiency for care.</p>
      <p>I’m still learning what that takes. But that’s the kind of work I want to do.</p>
