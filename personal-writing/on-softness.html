  <h1>On Softness</h1>

  <p>I used to believe that by a certain age, life would start to make sense. That after getting tossed around in your twenties, your thirties would bring calm—some stability, a few anchor truths.</p>

  <p>And in some ways, that’s true. You begin to see the shape of who you are. You learn what fits and what doesn’t. There’s something quietly powerful in that.</p>

  <p>But what I didn’t expect was how much the world would keep widening. How every answer tends to crack open another question. And how, instead of clarity, what often arrives is a kind of gentle blur. Maturity, it turns out, isn’t always about certainty—it might be about learning how to live inside the not-knowing.</p>

  <p>The deeper you go—into yourself, into others—the more you meet contradiction and complexity. And that can harden you. Or it can soften you.</p>

  <p>I want to stay soft.</p>

  <p>Not fragile, but receptive. Able to be moved. I want to keep noticing the way afternoon light falls across my kitchen table. The way grief sometimes arrives in the middle of laughter. The way failure can feel strangely tender, if you let it.</p>

  <p><strong>Softness isn’t weakness.</strong></p>

  <p>To stay open in a world that keeps telling you to toughen up—maybe that’s the most radical thing of all.</p>
