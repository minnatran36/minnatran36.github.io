    <h2>1. A Different Kind of Failure</h2>
    <p>The first time I heard the story of Sisyphus—the man cursed to roll a boulder uphill forever, only to watch it fall—I saw it as punishment. A warning to the proud. Endless effort, no reward. A loop designed not just to tire the body, but to break the spirit.</p>
    <p>But the image lingered—not for its grandeur, but for its quiet ache. This wasn’t a dramatic fall from grace. It was something quieter, more unsettling: a failure that wasn't sudden or final, just endless.</p>
    <p>What do you do with effort that leads nowhere?<br>
    What does it mean to keep trying when you know how it ends?</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. The Tyranny of Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Keynes once wrote, “In the long run, we are all dead.” He wasn’t joking. He was criticizing those who dismissed present pain in favor of some distant fix.</p>
    <p>But the line stays with me in another way. If everything ends—if the summit always resets—why strive at all? Why chase goals when death eventually wipes the slate clean?</p>
    <p>It sounds bleak. But maybe it’s just the wrong lens.</p>
    <p>Brushing your teeth doesn’t work once. Neither do friendships. Or marriage. Or art. These things matter not because they’re finished, but because they’re tended. Again and again.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Mistakes That Teach</h2>
    <p>An economics professor once told me: “Rationality means not making the same mistake twice.” It sounded neat. Clean. Reasonable.</p>
    <p>But what is the same mistake?</p>
    <p>Things change. You change. Two failures might look alike on the outside, but inside, they’re different. A new perspective. A new question. Sometimes the only way to know what’s changed is to do it again.</p>
    <p>Yet the quote stuck because it surfaces something we rarely admit: we fear repetition. We crave resolution. We want to get it right the first time.</p>
    <p>But most learning is circling back. Love. Skill. Insight. None of it moves in straight lines.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. The Work That Repeats</h2>
    <p>Deep work rarely arrives in one stroke. A proof doesn’t land whole. A poem isn’t born finished. Writers, builders, and thinkers return to the same place—not because they’re lost, but because they’re still listening.</p>
    <p>The more something matters, the more it pulls you back. Not to repeat—but to re-meet. To see what you missed. To notice what’s shifted in you.</p>
    <p>Even procrastination looks different in this light. Some research suggests stepping away lets your mind quietly reorganize. What feels like delay might be slow progress in disguise.</p>
    <p>Annie Duke puts it plainly: you can’t judge a decision by its outcome. Bad luck can follow a good choice. Good luck can hide a bad one.</p>
    <p>If we care about growth—not just success—then the test is how we return. How we sit with the hard parts. How we keep going, eyes open.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Time, Tinkering, and Learning to See</h2>
    <p>Physicist Leonard Mlodinow once noted that Stephen Hawking worked as if he had all the time in the world.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t just patience. It was trust in the process—an understanding that real insight unfolds slowly. What looks like failure might be a shift in how you see. What looks like repetition might be refinement.</p>
    <p>Most creative work isn’t a march to the finish. It’s a quiet kind of tinkering. A nudge, a return, another try.</p>
    <p>And people grow that way, too. You revisit the same question, the same fear—not because you failed to solve it, but because you’re someone new each time you try.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. The Point Was Never the Summit</h2>
    <p>Maybe Sisyphus wasn’t being punished. Maybe he was practicing—meeting the same weight, the same slope, each time with a slightly different mind.</p>
    <p>The rock didn’t change. But he did.</p>
    <p>Edison said, “I haven’t failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” We call it a cliché now, but it holds. If all you track is the result, then yes—it’s failure. But Edison wasn’t counting wins. He was learning the shape of the problem.</p>
    <p>Each "no" was information.</p>
    <p>Sisyphus was condemned for pride, trickery, defiance. The gods gave him a task that unraveled the moment he completed it. But maybe the real trap wasn’t the rock. Maybe it was the belief that the goal was to win.</p>
    <p>He didn’t fail because the rock fell. He only failed if he thought keeping it up was the point.</p>
    <p>The rock never stayed.<br>
    But it taught him how to see.</p>
