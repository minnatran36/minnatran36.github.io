      In my family, I fear my son.<br>
      He fears my husband.<br>
      But my husband fears me.

      The thing about being kind is—you also need to be specific.<br><br>
      The other day, I decided to give away some stuff we didn’t need anymore. I set it all on a table in front of our house with a sign that said “Free.”<br><br>
      The next morning, everything was still there.<br>
      But the table was gone.

      When my GPS said, “Go northeast,” I was confused… but also a little flattered.<br><br>

      People say I’m cute “in a quirky way.” Which I think means: technically not cute, but interesting enough that it confuses the eye.<br><br>
      It's like that song—You say it best when you say nothing at all.<br><br>
      Which could mean either:<br>
      “There’s something rare and beautiful about you that transcends words.”<br>
      Or: “Honestly, you peak when you shut up.”<br><br>
      Compliment or insult? No idea. But I’ll take it.
