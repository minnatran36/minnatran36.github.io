      <h1>Almost Funny</h1>
      <p>I write jokes to unwind. They’re about things in my life. Almost jokes. Almost things.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Ambiguity</summary>
        <div class="joke-body">
          People say I’m cute <em>“in a quirky way.” </em><br>
          I think that means: not exactly cute, but interesting enough to confuse the eye.<br>
          Like that romantic song—<i>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IobNcpiwpSc" target="_blank">You say it best when you say nothing at all</a>
          </i>.<br>
          Could mean: “There’s something rare and beautiful about you that transcends words.”<br>
          Or: “Shut up. Please shut up.”
        </div>
        <div class="joke-body">
          The thing about being kind is—you also need to be specific.<br>
          The other day, I decided to give away some stuff we didn’t need anymore.<br>
          I set it all on a table in front of our house with a sign that said “Free.”<br>
          The next morning, everything was still there.<br>
          But the table was gone.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Assumptions</summary>
        <div class="joke-body">
          When my GPS said, <i>“Go northeast,”</i><br>
          I was confused… but also a little flattered.<br>
          Like—<i>wow</i>, this intelligent machine really believes I know where <em>north</em> is.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Hierarchy</summary>
        <div class="joke-body">
          Power’s weird.<br>
          In my family, I fear my son.<br>
          He fears my husband.<br>
          But my husband fears me.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Learning</summary>
        <div class="joke-body">
          I’m a big fan of vicarious learning.<br>
          You don’t need to get hit by a truck to know it sucks.<br>
          But you can’t rely on it entirely.<br>
          Because while we all want to learn from others’ mistakes,<br>
          someone still has to be the other.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Unintended</summary>
        <div class="joke-body">
          I’m pretty sure the inventor of the plastic bag didn’t mean for it to last forever.<br>
          Which is exactly why it does.
        </div>
